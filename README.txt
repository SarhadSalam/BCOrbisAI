Hi, there!

Thanks for participating in this year's Orbis Challenge!

The Orbis Challenge was created in 2010 to inspire
and encourage young people to explore their programming talents,
creative thinking and problem solving abilities.

Your challenge is to build an AI to play a video game in 24 hours.
This year's video game is Luminis, a territory expansion strategy game.

We suggest that, before doing anything else, you read the manual first.
You can read the manual by double-clicking on Manual/index.html in the LUMINIS folder.

Thanks for reading me, and good luck!
